# Galileo
Code snippets for using intel galileo gen2, and grove starter kit.
I have a habit of writing tons of small, isolated code samples while debugging, experimenting, or learning new featueres. 
I figure it could benefit others if i post these snippets. 
While i will try my best to include some comments, there are no assurances of any code being 'neat'.
